          The Old English Sheepdog (OES) is a sweet-tempered family pet.
          They are affectionate and devoted to their family and love to spend
          time with their people. They are adaptable, easygoing, fun-loving,
          and robust. They can be a bit clownish and OES owners claim they
          have a great sense of humor. They definitely want to be the center
          of attention and if they don't get enough attention and affection
          from their humans, this can negatively affect their temperament and
          emotional wellbeing. These are large, boisterous dogs who can be a
          bit stubborn, so it is important to start with basic obedience
          training early.

          The Chihuahua is a confident, feisty, courageous, and loyal dog.
          He is loving, gentle and sweet-natured with his family. He likes to
          play games, and needs lots of attention, affection and petting. He
          usually becomes very attached to one member of the family in
          particular, and if you are his chosen one he will follow you
          everywhere you go.

          The Shih Tzu is a loving, friendly, gentle, playful, loyal and
          happy dog. He loves people and bonds with the entire family. He
          needs to give and receive a great deal of love and affection, and
          is not the kind of dog who can be left alone inside the house for
          many hours at a time, or kept outside in a yard. He is an indoor
          dog who needs to be petted, held, cuddled and pampered, and he is
          happiest napping on the couch with you for hours.
